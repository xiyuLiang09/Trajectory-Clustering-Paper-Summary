|9| Online clustering of streaming trajectories | Frontiers of Computer Science | 2018 | OCluST | [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11704-017-6325-0) | The author is the same as that of `TSCluWin`, and the method is similar to it. It includes a micro-clustering component for clustering and summarizing the latest trajectory segments at each time point, as well as a macro-clustering component for constructing macro-clusters based on micro-clusters within a specified time window. Although OCluST performs well in clustering streaming trajectory data, it relies on the sliding window model, which may be sensitive to the choice of window size, affecting the quality of clustering results. Additionally, it may face computational resource bottlenecks under high-frequency data streams.|

|13| Online clustering of trajectory data stream | MDM | 2016 | - | [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7517785/) | It processes real-time trajectory data using sliding window technology. This method maintains summary information of trajectory data within the sliding window to achieve online clustering of trajectory data streams. However, the choice of window size has a significant impact on clustering resultsâ€”a window that is too small may fail to capture patterns adequately, while a window that is too large may increase computational overhead. Moreover, this method may have limitations in handling concept drift and the dynamic changes of trajectory data. |

|18| Incremental Clustering for Trajectories | DASFAA | 2010 | TCMM | [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12098-5_3) | It is divided into two stages: online micro-cluster maintenance and offline macro-cluster creation. In the online stage, newly arriving trajectories are simplified into directed line segments and assigned to existing micro-clusters or used to create new micro-clusters based on similarity, capturing clustering features of trajectory segments. In the offline stage, the micro-clusters are further clustered to form macro-clusters, representing higher-level trajectory patterns.
